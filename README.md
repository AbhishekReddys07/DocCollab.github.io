## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- **Supabase account (REQUIRED)**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doccollab.git
cd doccollab
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Supabase Setup (CRITICAL - REQUIRED FOR APP TO WORK)

#### Step 1: Create a Supabase Project
1. **Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project**
2. **Choose a project name and password**
3. **Wait for the project to be fully set up (this can take a few minutes)**

#### Step 2: Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. **In your Supabase dashboard, go to Settings > API**
2. **Copy your Project URL** (looks like: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
3. **Copy your anon/public key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

#### Step 3: Run Database Migration
1. **In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor**
2. **Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250628105344_dark_bar.sql`**
3. **Paste and run the SQL script to create all necessary tables and policies**
4. **Verify that tables were created by checking the Table Editor**

#### Step 4: Configure Authentication
1. **Go to Authentication > Settings in your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Disable "Enable email confirmations" for development**
3. **Add your local development URL to "Site URL": `http://localhost:5173`**

### 4. Environment Configuration (REQUIRED)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Update `.env` with your actual Supabase credentials:**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials. The app will not work with the example values.**

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

**If you see "supabaseUrl is required" error, check that:**
- ‚úÖ Your `.env` file exists and has the correct values
- ‚úÖ Your Supabase project is active
- ‚úÖ You've restarted the development server after adding environment variables

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### Deploying from VS Code

#### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy from VS Code Terminal**
   ```bash
   # Build the project first
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your project settings
   - Add environment variables:
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase project URL
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anon key

5. **Alternative: GitHub Integration**
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Vercel will auto-deploy on every push

#### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Install Netlify CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to Netlify
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables via CLI
   netlify env:set VITE_SUPABASE_URL "your-supabase-url"
   netlify env:set VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY "your-anon-key"
   ```

#### Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Update package.json homepage**
   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/doccollab"
   }
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose "gh-pages"

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note for GitHub Pages:** Since GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side environment variables, you'll need to build with environment variables set locally or use GitHub Actions.

#### Option 4: Deploy to Railway

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**
   ```bash
   railway variables set VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
   railway variables set VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
   ```
